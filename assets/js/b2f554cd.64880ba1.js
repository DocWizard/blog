If you\'re still one of those people who remain unconvinced of this, then a) I envy you and b) Just wait for your first hardware-related disaster to happen - you\'ll sing a different tune. I, for one, have set up a simple bash script that automates syncing my home directory with an external hard drive every month.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nYou never know when your hard drive or SSD is going to give up the spirit. When it does, the consequences are entirely dependent on your previous actions. I like to follow the 3-2-1 backup strategy.\\n\\n### 3-2-1 backup strategy\\n\\nThis is a data protection strategy that\'s simple enough for a \'normal\' person to use, yet offers robust protection for your personal data. It\'s easy to remember:\\n\\n* Maintain <b>three</b> copies of your data - one can be the main copy on your personal computer, but you need at least two more copies.\\n* Use <b>two</b> different types of media - say, keep one copy on an external hard drive, and the other in the cloud.\\n* Keep <b>one</b> copy in a secondary location - just imagine that there\'s a fire and both your PC and the external hard drive you keep in your drawer burn down? This can be a server in the cloud, or... keep the external HDD at your parents\' house :)\\n\\nPersonally, I went with the path of least resistance: I have a copy of my most important files uploaded on OneDrive, and an external drive onto which I regularly upload my entire /home directory.\\n\\n### Backup script\\n\\nNow, theoretically I could just remember to backup my all files regularly. Unfortunately, mother nature has gifted me with a rather fickle memory. Besides, automation is fun! That\'s why I have a bash script scheduled to run on the 1st of every month, not only reminding me to make the backup, but also actually running it for me. I\'ll share the script with you - but don\'t blindly trust me, (or any script you download from the Internet, really). Be sure to go through it and figure out exactly what it does on your own!\\n\\nThis should work on any Linux distribution. I\'m running Arch, btw.\\n\\nFirst, as with any script, we specify the shell interpeter to use:\\n```\\n#!/bin/bash\\n```\\n\\nThen, I want to check if the external drive is mounted. First, I\'ll send myself a reminder to actually do it:\\n\\n```\\necho \\"It\'s time for your monthly /home backup. Connect your external drive.\\"\\nread -p \\"Press enter to continue...\\"\\n\\nif [ ! -d \\"/run/media/maciejk/Data2/\\" ]; then\\n    echo \\"External hard drive is not mounted.\\"\\n    exit 1\\nfi\\n```\\n\\nYou need to change the path to your own external HDD\'s mounting point.As you see, if the drive still isn\'t mounted, then the script exits. If it is mounted, then we begin to copy everything over. We\'ll also have a nice message at the end, indicating if everything went according to plan:\\n\\n```\\nrsync -avh --progress /home/maciejk/ /run/media/maciejk/Data2/homebackup\\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\\n    echo \\"Backup completed successfully.\\"\\nelse\\n    echo \\"Backup failed.\\"\\nfi\\n```\\n\\nAgain, change the paths to suit your own purposes. Save the script to a convenient place - ~/bin works just fine. Remember to add .sh at the end of your filename.\\n\\nAnd that\'s it, that\'s the basic version of the script. For it to run automatically, you will need to schedule its execution using cron:\\n\\n```\\ncrontab -e\\n```\\n\\nAnd add a new line to your crontab file:\\n\\n```\\n0 20 1 * * /path/to-yourscript.sh\\n```\\n\\nYou will need to replace <i>/path/to-yourscript.sh</i> with the path to your script, of course. This runs the script at 20:00 every first day of the month. If you want to run the script on a different timeline, I recommend using [fcrontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) to generate your own version of this line.\\n\\n### Backing up my packages\\n\\nAll this isn\'t enough for me. I have my /home directory backed up, but what if I need to reinstall my system from scratch? Do I have to remember what packages I had installed? No, we can save a list of installed packages as well by adding the following line to our script, right before the rsync operation:\\n\\n```\\npacman -Qqe > ~/.myPackages.txt\\n```\\n\\nThis is on Arch - any Arch-based distro will support this, but for apt or dnf, you\'ll have to figure it out on your own. Sorry!\\n\\nWhat this does is create a list of all your <b>explicitly</b> installed packages - that is those that you, yourself have installed so far. If you ever need to reinstall everything from scratch, simply run:\\n\\n```\\npacman -S --needed - < ~/.myPackages.txt\\n```\\n\\nAnd everything that was installed at the moment you made your backup should be restored.\\n\\n\\n### Summary\\nSo, to summarize - here\'s the complete version of my script. Remember to change the paths to reflect your own filesystem!\\n\\n```\\n#!/bin/bash\\n\\n# Display a message prompting the user to plug in the external drive\\necho \\"It\'s time for your monthly /home backup. Plug your external drive in and press enter to continue.\\"\\nread -p \\"Press enter to continue...\\"\\n\\n# Check if the external hard drive is mounted\\nif [ ! -d \\"/run/media/maciejk/Data2/\\" ]; then\\n    echo \\"External hard drive is not mounted.\\"\\n    exit 1\\nfi\\n\\n# Create a list of explicitly installed packages\\necho \\"Drive detected, creating package list...\\"\\npacman -Qqe > ~/.myPackages.txt\\n\\n# Copy the entire home directory to the external hard drive\\nrsync -avh --progress /home/maciejk/ /run/media/maciejk/Data2/homebackup\\n\\n# Check if rsync was successful\\nif [ $? -eq 0 ]; then\\n    echo \\"Backup completed successfully.\\"\\nelse\\n    echo \\"Backup failed.\\"\\nfi\\n```"},{"id":"SME-handling-tips","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/SME-handling-tips","source":"@site/blog/2024-04-10-SME-tips.md","title":"Stuck in Limbo - How to Handle Radio-Silent SMEs in Technical Writing","description":"Article on dealing with mute SMEs","date":"2024-04-10T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"label":"Technical Writing","permalink":"/blog/tags/technical-writing"},{"label":"SME","permalink":"/blog/tags/sme"}],"readingTime":4.91,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Maciej Kitlasz (DocWizard)","title":"Technical Writer","url":"https://www.kitlasz.eu/","imageURL":"/blog/img/face.png","key":"DocWizard"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Stuck in Limbo - How to Handle Radio-Silent SMEs in Technical Writing","description":"Article on dealing with mute SMEs","slug":"SME-handling-tips","authors":"DocWizard","tags":["Technical Writing","SME"],"image":"/img/SME/why.png","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Handy bash backup script","permalink":"/blog/backup-script"}},"content":"Being a technical writer as an introvert can be challenging, to say the least. You must learn to work with other people - your SMEs, who can either be your best friends... or an utter nightmare! Read on to find out what to do if you find yourself dealing with the latter.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<blockquote>Knowledge is meant to be shared.</blockquote>\\n\\nIn the realm of technical writing, the collaboration between writers and Subject Matter Experts (SME) thrives on knowledge sharing. SMEs hold specialized knowledge in their respective fields, and their role involves imparting this knowledge to technical writers. Conversely, technical writers translate this expertise into accessible and understandable content for a broader audience - internal or external. \\n\\n<p>The free flow and sharing of knowledge among SMEs, writers, and broader teams are fundamental pillars that drive success, efficiency, and the creation of high-quality technical documentation. </p>\\n<p>In an ideal world, this flow of knowledge is smooth, friendly and uninterrupted. But anyone who has tried to schedule an interview with an expert knows \u2014 it\'s rarely that simple. Experts are busy people, and their knowledge and skills are in high demand. </p>\\n<h1>Why do SMEs go MIA?</h1>\\n\\n![Banner image](../static/img/SME/why_wide.png)\\n\\n<p>Subject Matter Experts might become unresponsive due to various reasons - both professional and personal. To become an expert SME tamer, you must at least try to understand their perspective:</p>\\n<ul>\\n <li>SMEs often juggle multiple responsibilities, including their primary duties, projects, meetings, and deadlines. They might become unresponsive due to their heavy workload and time constraints, making it challenging to prioritize additional requests. An interview with you - while important - adds more to their plate.</li>\\n<li>Sometimes, SMEs may not fully comprehend the importance or urgency of their input for the technical writing project. They might not realize how their expertise directly contributes to creating accurate documentation or the impact of their unresponsiveness on project timelines. They might also be unfamiliar with or inexperienced in collaborating with technical writers. They might not understand their role or how to effectively engage in the collaboration process, leading to hesitation or avoidance.</li>\\n<li>In some cases, communication barriers such as language differences, misinterpretation of the request, or difficulties in grasping the scope of the project may lead to SMEs being unresponsive. These hurdles can hinder effective collaboration.</li>\\n<li>Personal reasons such as illness, family emergencies, or unexpected events can also cause SMEs to become unresponsive unexpectedly - take this into account if a deadline is looming on the horizon.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h1>What to do before the interview?</h1>\\n\\n<p>Fear not, dear tech writer, for not all hope is lost. There are steps you can take before reaching out to the SME to minimize the chances of being brushed off:</p>\\n\\n<ul>\\n<li><b>Come prepared</b> - Familiarize yourself with the project or document you\'re working on. Conduct preliminary research on the subject matter. Understand basic concepts and terminologies related to the topic. This will not only help you ask informed and relevant questions during the interview. Showing your expertise upfront can encourage SMEs to assist you.</li>\\n<li><b>Extablish interview objectives and prepare questions in advance</b> - this is as true in journalism as it is in tech writing. You need to determine the specific goals you aim to achieve during the interview. Whether it\'s to gather technical details, understand processes, or seek clarification on specific points, having clear objectives helps in steering the conversation in the right direction. Sending these questions to the expert beforehand can also help streamline the conversation.</li>\\n<li><b>Schedule and Logistics</b> - Figure out the best way of conducting the interview -  whether it\'s in-person, via phone, video call, or email. Ensure you have all necessary tools (notebooks, recording devices, etc.) ready for your talk.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Remember - by adequately preparing for the interview, you can maximize the efficiency of the interaction, gather accurate information, and build a strong working relationship with the SME, leading to high-quality technical documentation. </p>\\n\\n<h1>Time to reach out</h1>\\n\\n<p>When ready, reach out to the expert through a preferred channel\u2014email, Slack, or another medium. Use multiple channels judiciously to avoid overwhelming the expert.</p>\\n\\n<p>Be polite and efficient in your communication. <b> Clearly outline the purpose of your interview and the urgency of their input. Communicate specific information needed, project scope, and timelines. </b> Acknowledge their busy schedule; offer flexible communication options and respect their time constraints. Highlight the critical role their expertise plays in meeting deadlines.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>While awaiting the SME\'s response, explore existing documentation or consult knowledgeable colleagues or secondary sources for preliminary information. Who knows - you might find answers to many questions on your own.</p>\\n\\n<p>If your chosen SME doesn\'t respond - explore if there are other SMEs or experts within the organization who might be able to provide similar insights or information. While maintaining accuracy is crucial, an alternative source might help fill the gap temporarily. You can also explore publicly available resources or documentation related to the subject matter. While not ideal, these resources might offer insights that partially address your information needs.</p>\\n\\n\\n<p>Patience is key, but persistence pays off. Remember that you\'re not asking for a personal favor - this is a crucial part of your job. If the situation persists and impacts the project\'s progress, consider reaching out to the SME\'s supervisor or manager. Politely explain the situation and seek their support in facilitating communication or involvement. This should be treated as the nuclear option, however, and will earn you no favor from anyone involved.</p>\\n\\n<h1>Mission accomplished</h1>\\n\\n![Stylized image of an inteview](../static/img/SME/interview.png)\\n\\n<p>With luck, you should now have an interview scheduled. Afterward, review your notes for clarity and completeness. Seek clarification through follow-up communication if any points remain unclear. Always thank the SME for their time and valuable input!</p>\\n\\n<p>Building a robust working relationship with the SME leads to high-quality technical documentation. Remember, documentation is a means of knowledge sharing among team members, departments, and organizations\u2014crucial for growth, innovation, and continuous improvement.</p>"}]}')}}]);
