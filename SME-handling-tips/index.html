You must learn to work with other people - your SMEs, who can either be your best friends... or an utter nightmare! Read on to find out what to do if you find yourself dealing with the latter.</p>
<blockquote>Knowledge is meant to be shared.</blockquote>
<p>In the realm of technical writing, the collaboration between writers and Subject Matter Experts (SME) thrives on knowledge sharing. SMEs hold specialized knowledge in their respective fields, and their role involves imparting this knowledge to technical writers. Conversely, technical writers translate this expertise into accessible and understandable content for a broader audience - internal or external.</p>
<p>The free flow and sharing of knowledge among SMEs, writers, and broader teams are fundamental pillars that drive success, efficiency, and the creation of high-quality technical documentation. </p>
<p>In an ideal world, this flow of knowledge is smooth, friendly and uninterrupted. But anyone who has tried to schedule an interview with an expert knows — it&#x27;s rarely that simple. Experts are busy people, and their knowledge and skills are in high demand. </p>
<h1>Why do SMEs go MIA?</h1>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Banner image" src="/blog/assets/images/why_wide-802e6a72a949c992247f4ff95c14d98c.png" width="1152" height="326" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Subject Matter Experts might become unresponsive due to various reasons - both professional and personal. To become an expert SME tamer, you must at least try to understand their perspective:</p>
<ul><li>SMEs often juggle multiple responsibilities, including their primary duties, projects, meetings, and deadlines. They might become unresponsive due to their heavy workload and time constraints, making it challenging to prioritize additional requests. An interview with you - while important - adds more to their plate.</li><li>Sometimes, SMEs may not fully comprehend the importance or urgency of their input for the technical writing project. They might not realize how their expertise directly contributes to creating accurate documentation or the impact of their unresponsiveness on project timelines. They might also be unfamiliar with or inexperienced in collaborating with technical writers. They might not understand their role or how to effectively engage in the collaboration process, leading to hesitation or avoidance.</li><li>In some cases, communication barriers such as language differences, misinterpretation of the request, or difficulties in grasping the scope of the project may lead to SMEs being unresponsive. These hurdles can hinder effective collaboration.</li><li>Personal reasons such as illness, family emergencies, or unexpected events can also cause SMEs to become unresponsive unexpectedly - take this into account if a deadline is looming on the horizon.</li></ul>
<h1>What to do before the interview?</h1>
<p>Fear not, dear tech writer, for not all hope is lost. There are steps you can take before reaching out to the SME to minimize the chances of being brushed off:</p>
<ul><li><b>Come prepared</b> - Familiarize yourself with the project or document you&#x27;re working on. Conduct preliminary research on the subject matter. Understand basic concepts and terminologies related to the topic. This will not only help you ask informed and relevant questions during the interview. Showing your expertise upfront can encourage SMEs to assist you.</li><li><b>Extablish interview objectives and prepare questions in advance</b> - this is as true in journalism as it is in tech writing. You need to determine the specific goals you aim to achieve during the interview. Whether it&#x27;s to gather technical details, understand processes, or seek clarification on specific points, having clear objectives helps in steering the conversation in the right direction. Sending these questions to the expert beforehand can also help streamline the conversation.</li><li><b>Schedule and Logistics</b> - Figure out the best way of conducting the interview -  whether it&#x27;s in-person, via phone, video call, or email. Ensure you have all necessary tools (notebooks, recording devices, etc.) ready for your talk.</li></ul>
<p>Remember - by adequately preparing for the interview, you can maximize the efficiency of the interaction, gather accurate information, and build a strong working relationship with the SME, leading to high-quality technical documentation. </p>
<h1>Time to reach out</h1>
<p>When ready, reach out to the expert through a preferred channel—email, Slack, or another medium. Use multiple channels judiciously to avoid overwhelming the expert.</p>
<p>Be polite and efficient in your communication. <b> Clearly outline the purpose of your interview and the urgency of their input. Communicate specific information needed, project scope, and timelines. </b> Acknowledge their busy schedule; offer flexible communication options and respect their time constraints. Highlight the critical role their expertise plays in meeting deadlines.</p>
<p>While awaiting the SME&#x27;s response, explore existing documentation or consult knowledgeable colleagues or secondary sources for preliminary information. Who knows - you might find answers to many questions on your own.</p>
<p>If your chosen SME doesn&#x27;t respond - explore if there are other SMEs or experts within the organization who might be able to provide similar insights or information. While maintaining accuracy is crucial, an alternative source might help fill the gap temporarily. You can also explore publicly available resources or documentation related to the subject matter. While not ideal, these resources might offer insights that partially address your information needs.</p>
<p>Patience is key, but persistence pays off. Remember that you&#x27;re not asking for a personal favor - this is a crucial part of your job. If the situation persists and impacts the project&#x27;s progress, consider reaching out to the SME&#x27;s supervisor or manager. Politely explain the situation and seek their support in facilitating communication or involvement. This should be treated as the nuclear option, however, and will earn you no favor from anyone involved.</p>
<h1>Mission accomplished</h1>

<p>With luck, you should now have an interview scheduled. Afterward, review your notes for clarity and completeness. Seek clarification through follow-up communication if any points remain unclear. Always thank the SME for their time and valuable input!</p>
<p>Building a robust working relationship with the SME leads to high-quality technical documentation. Remember, documentation is a means of knowledge sharing among team members, departments, and organizations—crucial for growth, innovation, and continuous improvement.</p></div><footer class="docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="row margin-top--sm theme-blog-footer-edit-meta-row"><div class="col"><b>Tags:</b><ul class="tags_jXut padding--none margin-left--sm"><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/technical-writing">Technical Writing</a></li><li class="tag_QGVx"><a class="tag_zVej tagRegular_sFm0" href="/blog/tags/sme">SME</a></li></ul></div></div></footer></article></main></div></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2024 Maciej Kitlasz.
